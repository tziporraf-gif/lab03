        <p>This is the second lab assighnment and I already learned so much. It looked really complicated when I was reading all the new tags, but once I got to practice it I am actually having a lot of fun with it. I think the way the professor is teaching it online with all the links to dive deaper in the reading material is making it so much easier to learn it. So far I'm loving this class. </p>
        <p>I learned how to make a External CSS adding colors to words, changing fonts, spacing, backround colors and changing letter sizes.  </p>
